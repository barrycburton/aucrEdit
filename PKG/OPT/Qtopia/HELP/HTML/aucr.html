<p align="justify"> 
AUCR is a novel single character, online handwriting recognition algorithm, designed for resource poor embedded devices.  It is hoped that the new methods introduced by AUCR will allow higher levels of recognition accuracy, while at the same time offering lower computational costs, such that cheaper devices may take advantage of handwriting recognition.  The AUCR algorithm is based on the idea of elastic structural matching, which views each character as a stroke, or curve, which can be divided into finitely many segments, each of which having a specific general direction.  The cornerstone of the AUCR algorithm, however, is a new metric, called activity, which provides a unique, compressed measure of the various directions contained over either the whole stroke of the character, or some multi-segment sub-stroke of the character.  The activity metric overcomes many of the shortcomings found in previous recognition algorithms and allows the recognition engine to be completely alphabet independent, such that any user specified alphabet may be used with the algorithm.

AUCR is the work of William Confer <a href="mailto:wconfer@eng.auburn.edu">&lt;wconfer@eng.auburn.edu&gt;</a> and Dr. Richard Chapman <a href="mailto:chapman@eng.auburn.edu">&lt;chapman@eng.auburn.edu&gt;</a>, both of Auburn University.  The AUCR algorithm is covered by a patent currently held by Auburn University.
