aucrEdit:Alphabet provides an interface to create, edit, and save AUCR API character alphabets.  It allows each character to have up to 3 drawings, which means that the alphabet itself can contain up to 3 separate instances of each character, which increases the recognition accuracy because 3 instances will have a better chance of containing all of the quirks in an individual's style of drawing of a letter.  The top 3 boxes allow the 3 different instances of whatever character is selected.  The &quot;Character:&quot; field shows what the currently selected character is.  The keyboard allows different keys to be toggled, selecting different characters to edit.  Please note that the shift and caps keys do not select a character for editing, but rather alter the keyboard, changing the available keys, so that a different set of characters is available for selection.  These keys mimic the functionality of their analogues on a normal keyboard.  To use the editor, simply select the character you would like to alter/provide a representation for, then make the appropriate drawings in the character editor boxes.

The file menu contains entries for creating a new alphabet file, which will have no characters entered, opening an alphabet file, which may be any alphabet file created by the AUCR API, saving the currently open alphabet if it has been edited, and saving the currently open alphabet as a different file. You can also choose to quit the application, which has the same functionality as pressing the x in the top right corner. None of the entries in the Edit menu apply to editing alphabets. The view menu has a&quot;Text Editor&quot; entry, which switches the application into aucrEdit:Text mode.
