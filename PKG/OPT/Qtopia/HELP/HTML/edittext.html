aucrEdit:Text is a standard plain text editor, much the same as Notepad or Simpletext, with the exception of the small rectangular region found at the bottom of the window.  This region allows characters to be drawn, and then using the currently loaded alphabet, recognized, and then inserted into the text field.  Keep in mind that the recognition algorithm finds the character in the alphabet which is closest to the character drawn, so it will not recognize a character which is not in the alphabet.  Also keep in mind the alphabet used for recognition will be the currently loaded alphabet, which will contain any changes made since opening the alphabet, even if the alphabet has not been saved.

For the most part the possible operations and menu entries are fairly self explanatory, so only a quick overview will be given.  Under the file menu, you can create a new text file, open an existing file, save an edited file, and save the open file as another name.  You can also do the same operations to an alphabet, but those operations are covered in the aucrEdit:Alphabet section.  You can also choose to quit the application, which has the same functionality as pressing the x in the top right corner.  The edit menu features &quot;cut&quot;, &quot;copy&quot;, &quot;paste&quot;, &quot;delete&quot;, and &quot;select&quot; all entries, which correspond to normal text editing operations.  The view menu has an &quot;Alphabet Editor&quot; entry for switching the mode to aucrEdit:Alphabet, as well as an &quot;Always Clear&quot; toggle entry, which is either enabled or disabled.  If always clear is enabled, a check mark appears beside the text.  Clicking on the &quot;Always Clear&quot; entry toggles between enabled and disabled.  If always clear is enabled, the recognition area will clear every time a new character is started, so that you only see the most recent character drawn.  When always clear is disabled, the recognition area is only cleared when a new character is to the left of the previous character.  This allows the characters for entire words to be visible in the recognition area at time, which may help some users in remembering which character in word they are currently writing.  The setting for &quot;Always Clear&quot; is saved when the application is closed, so that when the application is started again it will be in the same mode as when it was closed.
